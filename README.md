# MusicGenerationLearning
This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning about music generation using Python.
It will serve as a collection of code and examples
that demonstrate different approaches and techniques for creating music algorithmically.

Please note that the code and examples included here are not originally created by me
but are compiled from various sources.
The purpose of this repository is to gather and experiment with different methods for generating music.
